# Visualization Exercises
## 🔍 Overview
his lab is designed to help you practice data visualization using Python. It will provide you with an opportunity to practice manipulating and visualizing data using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Bokeh, and will focus on choosing appropriate visualization methods based on data type and research questions.

### Emojis Legend
Throughout the assignment instructions, you'll find some emojis that will help you navigate the instructions. Here's what they mean:

- 👨🏻‍💻 - Instructions; Tells you about something specific you need to do.
- 🦉 - Tips; Will tell you about some hints, tips and best practices
- 📜 - Documentations; provides links to documentations
- 🚩 - Checkpoint; marks a good spot for you to commit your code to git
- 🕵️ - Tester; Don't modify code blocks starting with this emoji
This is inspired by @kentcdodds workshops.

## 🎯 Objectives
